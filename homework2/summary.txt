My data set is a collection of the top 100 posts from the subreddit "r/politics."
On reddit.com, subreddits serve as "community hubs" for a variety of different
topics and interests. r/Politics is specifically about US Politics and Elections.

The data in the CSV file include the Submission Title of each post, the URL, the Author, the
"Score" (net likes vs dislikes) of each post, and the time each post was created.

Some interesting things about this data set is that only a select few authors and
URLs appear on the top posts of all time. In addition, a large percent of the Submission
titles include the word "Trump."

As for the plots, there are two plots attempting to show the distribution when it comes
to author and URL, respectively. It was found that in both categories, there is a large
disparity.

Another plot is a Word Cloud, with the source text being the Submission Titles
of the top 300 posts. This is meant to show what topics/words are being most upvoted
on r/politics

The final plot is a scatter plot showing varience in the score of the top posts of all time,
along with a red-blue color coding to show whether or not a post's submission title
contained the word trump.
