####    COMMON BETWEEN SUMMARIES    ###

The data I used for this homework was collected via an MTurk survey that asked
respondents about their non-essential spending habits before and after the
pandemic, along with the types of financial assistance, if any, they received.

The survey asked essentially three questions, structured as follows


Q1: How has your non-essential spending changed since the beginning of the
    pandemic?

    Much lower
    Slightly lower
    About the same
    Slightly higher
    Much Higher


Q2: If your spending has decreased, why do you think that is?
Q3: If your spending has increased, why do you think that is?


Q4: What types, if any, of government/public financial assistance have you
    received?

    This question included answers such as Paycheck Protection Program, Pandemic
    Unemployment Assistance, and University Aid that were categorized as
    "Recurring Payments." The one time $1,200 Stimulus Check was categorized as
    "One Time Payment." Respondents who received both Recurring and One-Time
    payments were categorized as "Combo Payments." And, naturally, those who
    didn't receive any financial assistance are denoted by "No Aid"

####      END COMMON      ####


The way the data was clustered as using a simple Kmeans clustering. I 'coded'
the responses to Question 1, one-hot encoded all the answers for Questions 2 and
3, and coded the different types of Aid as 0, 1, 3, and 5 for No Aid, One-Time,
Recurring, and Combo, respectively.

The clusters that were created centered either the types of aid received, the
reported change in spending, or both.

Two of the more interesting clusters generated were Clusters 0 and 1.

Cluster 0 is entirely comprised of respondents who reported decreased spending
to some degree. On top of that, well over 90% of those in that cluster either
reported No Aid or One-time payment. This points to the conclusion that the
people who only got the Stimulus Check, or nothing at all, were the people who
decreased their spending during the pandemic. It seems that the One-time Payment
was not enough to prevent a decrease in spending.

On the other side of that same coin, we have Cluster 1. This cluster is entirely
respondents that reported increased spending to some degree or reported no
change. Within that, every single respondent in this cluster received Recurring
Payments, or the One-time payment along with Recurring Payments. This shows that
the Recurring Payments, as opposed to the One-time Payment, were enough to
prevent decreases in spending. The output for this is included as "no_demos.txt"
